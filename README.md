Hello, ladies and gentlemen! This is one of the my React pet project. The project is related to the Marvel Universe. You can see the project itself here: [marvel-wiki-green.vercel.app](https://marvel-wiki-green.vercel.app/). The API was taken from https://developer.marvel.com

As soon as you enter, you will be greeted with this view:

At the top you will see a section where you can see a random hero:

Some heroes may not have an avatar or description. But it's not my fault. This means an error on the part of the API.

At the bottom you will see a list of heroes and a stub on the right side. As you select a character, the comic book list where the character appeared will appear in place of the stub.

Also at the top you might have seen the comic strip section:

If you click on it, you'll go here:

Here you can also select a comic book, and it will show the information

Oh! I forgot one more thing. In the first section, you might have seen the search section under the plug. There you can write the hero's name and it will find it for you. (Although it needs some tweaking). And, of course, there's a page about the hero.
